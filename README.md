# NC-Games Boardgame Review React Project

Deployed via GitHub Pages, <a href="https://itskatherine.github.io/nc-games">can be found here</a>.

In this project I used React to build the front end of a games review website, using the backend API built <a href="https://github.com/itskatherine/boardgames_hosted">by myself here</a>, and hosted <a href="https://katherineboardgames.herokuapp.com/api">using Heroku here</a>.

You can navigate through the app, it includes:

A Home page with a list of reviews, which can be ordered by category: https://itskatherine.github.io/nc-games

Individual review pages, an example of one is here:

The user can add and delete comments.
